# relp-input-plugin
Plugin for TCP input to fluentd using RELP

for the time being this is simple "Hello world" fluentd input plugin
which receives anything over TCP and passes it to fluentd AS-IS, with 
no processing, filtering or parsing whatsoever.

Will update this README once more functionality is added.
